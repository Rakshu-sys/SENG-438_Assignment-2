# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

First, we will discuss the Java documentation in order to have a understanding of how the DataUtilities and Range classes work. After mastering the basics of their use, we will then outline the 10 test cases and start coding. 

For DataUtilities, we will use 5 out of its 9 methods as benchmark test cases. We can always add more unit tests if we think the methods being tested require it. 
For Range, we will explore 5 out of its 23 methods to test according to the same guideline and if there is a need, to add more cases for testing. 

After deciding which sets of the methods to test, we will then choose the best black-box testing methods such as equivalence classes and boundary testing that we will use in order to have a complete and reliable test cases.
