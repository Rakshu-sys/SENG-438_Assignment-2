# 1 Introduction


This lab aims on teaching the basics of unit testing. The framework we use is JUnit. Our system needs to be tested using unit testing as it is important for reliability. We test the system in a package called org.jfree.data using JFreeChart framework. It contains multiple classes, however we focus on testing the two classes: Range and DataUtilities. The class DataUtilities also uses mock  objects through JMock. This lab provides us a an opportunity to apply our theoretical knowledge of the unit testing. In this lab, we use resources like API specifications provided in the lab folder, javadoc documentations, and lecture material in order to get more familiar with the concepts of unit testing. 


# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

First, we will discuss the Java documentation in order to have a understanding of how the DataUtilities and Range classes work. After mastering the basics of their use, we will then outline the 10 test cases and start coding. 

For DataUtilities, we will use all of its  methods as benchmark test cases. We can always add more unit tests if we think the methods being tested require it. 
For Range, we will explore 5 out of its 15  methods to test according to the same guideline and if there is a need, to add more cases for testing. 

After deciding which sets of the methods to test, we will then choose the best black-box testing methods such as equivalence classes and boundary testing that we will use in order to have a complete and reliable test cases.
